Today, my good friend and I came to my house to cook. He couldn't go home, 
so he came to my place to work on his assignments.
What we're going to make is fried rice because it's simple, 
straightforward, and doesn't require much effort. 
Just throw everything in and stir-fry, and it'll taste delicious.
It's touching that even though the price of iced tea has increased,
 my local supermarket is still selling it so cheaply.
We went to the supermarket and bought some ham and carrots as side ingredients.
 Ham is always the key ingredient for fried rice.
Now it's cooking time. Let's start by quickly preparing the carrots and ham.
This carrot is so damn hard, it's impossible to cut through.
Alright, it's time to stir-fry the ingredients. I won't say much. Let's quietly enjoy my superb culinary skills.
I think my fried rice is quite delicious, perfectly cooked. Unlike my good friend, who tends to burn his. Haha.
